description: "An Internet-enabled Restaurant Management System"
---

<h1>The System</h1>
<p>The Bleepr system is a novel solution to the problem of restaurant table management. In many popular establishments,
    a customer has to provide the restaurant with the number of the table they are seated at, or is assigned one at time of order,
    and tracking the association of order to table can hinder the ability of service staff to perform their jobs. Furthermore, 
    the customer recieves very little feedback on the state of their order after purchase, and this can create the perception of poor service.
    Our system solves these issues by providing an on-table device that tracks individual customers across visits through the use of
    RFID technology. Our device provides customers with a means to track the status of their order, and request assistance from service staff,
    as well as providing restaurant staff with an automated method of tracking tables and their associated orders, and providing restaurant
    owners and managers with more detailed metrics on the efficiency of their service and the desires of their customers.
