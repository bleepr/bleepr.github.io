## Introduction
For our project, we settled upon the idea of a Bleepr, an Internet-of-Things device designed for use in a food service environment.
Our system provdes restauranteurs with a web and mobile interface to a cloud-based service for managing their venue, with on-table
customer interaction devices (the eponymous Bleepr) interacting with the service via means of a Bluetooth Low-Power relay. Customers
can use the Bleepr device to perform common restaurant activities, such as calling a waiter and requesting the bill, and additionally can
monitor their order status as it progresses through the kitchen. The device benefits staff by acting as a table marker,
allowing waiting staff to know where on the floor the meal is to be served, and benefits management by providing a method of tracking various
restaurant metrics such as mean time to order completion, customer visit counts and heat maps of table activity.

We modelled the system as 3 sections: Frontends, Relay and Hardware. The frontends section consists of the mobile and web staff applications,
as well as a table booking application. The relay section consists of the hardware and software components needed to communicate with both
the cloud service and the Bleepr hardware. Finally, the hardware section consists of the design and implementation of the Bleepr hardware and
firmware.

For my part in the project, I was responsible for the implementation of the mobile frontend, targetting the Android platform.

## Requirements
The minimum viable featureset we decided on for the mobile frontend required that the app be able to:

* Display information on table status
* Display information on future table occupancy events
* Display information on open and in-progress orders
* Allow order state to be changed and the change to be reflected in the cloud service

## Design and Implementation
Why it looks like it does and how it does what it does

## Evaluation and Improvements
What's good and bad about it and how to make it better

## Summary
We made an Android app
