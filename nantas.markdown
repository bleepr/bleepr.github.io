# Web front-end

## Introduction
Bleepr is a system meant to make both the consumer and the restaurateur
experience better and significantly more modern. It brings the connectivity and
interface to the Internet of Things while maintaining the interpersonal
experience you get in restaurants and pubs, and it does so by being both
comprehensive and seamless in its execution. To satisfy such requirements we
created two kinds of user interfaces: the Bleepr box and the application
front-ends.

I was personally responsible for the creation of the web interface for the staff,
the design of some useful data analytic and the testing of the server API for
all the interfaces together with Craig.

## Specifications
The purpose of my role was mostly to build the web front-end for the members of
the staff of the restaurant. The system needed to:
* support multiple users and multiple typologies of users (that is,
  owners/admins and standard staff). That is:
  - provide the ability to add admins and standard users
  - provide the ability to delete admins and standard users
* support multiple Bleeprs. That is:
  - provide a way to add one or multiple Bleeprs to the system.
  - provide a way to delete one or multiple Bleeprs to the system.
* allow the staff to visualise the status of the restaurant and the Bleeprs
  linked to the system.

Additionally the system needed to display some of the collected information
about the restaurant, to allow the staff to gain knowledge about long-term
trends and to get some insights on possible issues in the restaurant.


## Design
Process + tech

## Evaluation
How did the system fare? Could had it been better?

In terms of data analysis, it is clear that the system is comprehensive and
robust in terms of what's visualised, but much of the power of machine learning
has not been used yet. For instance using only the gradient of the last few data
points to provide estimates of future values greatly limits the prediction's
accuracy. A better way to use the data would be to construct a model not only
based on previous data, but also on environmental data such as weather, city
events, tourism data and so on.

## Conclusions

The web front end was functional and completely up to the requirements by the
time of the demonstration. The data providers and visualisers gave a reasonable
idea of both the status of the restaurant and possible data-driven trends, and
the interface to manage the Bleeprs got actually used to perform the demo. Given
the effort spent in clearly splitting the module, the design ended up being
clearly modular and usable in professional settings. Because of lack of User
Experience training, adjustment to the visual interface and a visual re-design
are still clearly needed, but the project has been definitely satisfactory.

## Design choices

We needed a 3d printed box. Then another. 'cause it was cool. Turns out making
it pretty was pretty hard.

## Technical details

3d printer + material details. Internal refinements. Cool stuff.

## End product
