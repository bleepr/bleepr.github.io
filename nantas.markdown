# Web front-end

## Introduction
Bleepr is a system meant to make both the consumer and the restaurateur
experience better and significantly more modern. It brings the connectivity and
interface to the Internet of Things while maintaining the interpersonal
experience you get in restaurants and pubs, and it does so by being both
comprehensive and seamless in its execution. To satisfy such requirements we
created two kinds of user interfaces: the Bleepr box and the application
front-ends.

I was personally responsible for the creation of the web interface for the staff,
the design of some useful data analytic and the testing of the server API for
all the interfaces together with Craig.

## Specifications
The purpose of my role was mostly to build the web front-end for the members of
the staff of the restaurant. The system needed to:
* support multiple users and multiple typologies of users (that is,
  owners/admins and standard staff). That is:
  - provide the ability to add admins and standard users
  - provide the ability to delete admins and standard users
* support multiple Bleeprs. That is:
  - provide a way to add one or multiple Bleeprs to the system.
  - provide a way to delete one or multiple Bleeprs to the system.
* allow the staff to visualise the status of the restaurant and the Bleeprs
  linked to the system.

Additionally the system needed to display some of the collected information
about the restaurant, to allow the staff to gain knowledge about long-term
trends and to get some insights on possible issues in the restaurant.


## Design
Process + tech

## Evaluation
How did the system fare? Could had it been better?

## Conclusions
Front-end was functional, reasonable amount of data output, optimal bleepr
control.

# Bleepr Design

## Design choices

We needed a 3d printed box. Then another. 'cause it was cool. Turns out making
it pretty was pretty hard.

## Technical details

3d printer + material details. Internal refinements. Cool stuff.

## End product
