# Web front-end

## Introduction
Bleepr is a system meant to make both the consumer and the restaurateur
experience better and significantly more modern. It brings the connectivity and
interface to the Internet of Things while maintaining the interpersonal
experience you get in restaurants and pubs, and it does so by being both
comprehensive and seamless in its execution. To do so, the project required the
creation of two kinds of user interfaces: the Bleepr box and the application
front-ends.

I was responsible for the creation the web interface for the staff,
the design of some useful data analytic and the testing of the server API for
all the interfaces.

## Specifications
Established minimum feature set

## Design
Process + tech

## Evaluation
How did the system fare? Could had it been better?

## Conclusions
Front-end was functional, reasonable amount of data output, optimal bleepr
control.

# Bleepr Design

## Design choices

We needed a 3d printed box. Then another. 'cause it was cool. Turns out making
it pretty was pretty hard.

## Technical details

3d printer + material details. Internal refinements. Cool stuff.
