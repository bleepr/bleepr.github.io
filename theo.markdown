## My Role
Hardware things

## Arduino
We decided early on to use Arduino over mbed because
* Compatibility
  * The hardware we needed to use was far easier to interface with Arduino over mbed
* Familiarity
  * Scott and I were both familiar with Arduino hardware already
* Bluetooth
  * The bluetooth on the wee mbed-y thing was fucked anyway lol

## Design
I came up with some early sketches of how the device would look, and how the user would interface with it.
